## How to Use
To use the mortgage calculator:

i. Open the script in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
ii. Run the script.
iii. When prompted, enter the following information:
   - The **mortgage loan principal** (the amount you are borrowing).
   - The **annual interest rate** (as a percentage).
   - The **number of years** to repay the mortgage.
iv. The script will then output the **monthly repayment** and the **total amount paid** over the life of the mortgage loan.

## Example
Welcome to the mortgage calculator

Enter the mortgage loan principal: $ 200000

Enter the annual interest rate: 5

Enter the number of years to repay the mortgage: 30

For a 30-year mortgage loan of $ 200,000.00:

at an annual interest rate of 5.00%:

you pay $ 1,073.64 monthly
----------------------------------------

Total amount paid will be $ 386,510.40

Thank you for using the mortgage calculator!

## Features
- **Monthly Payment Calculation**: Computes the monthly mortgage payment based on the principal, interest rate, and loan term.
- **Total Payment**: Outputs the total amount paid over the loan's lifetime.
- **Simple User Interface**: Easy to modify and expand for more complex mortgage-related calculations.

## Customization
You can modify the script to suit your specific requirements, such as incorporating additional features (e.g., adjustable-rate mortgages, extra payments, or fees).

## Enjoy!
